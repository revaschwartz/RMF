<summary markdown="span">**About**</summary>      
<br>
Mapping context may include examination of the following:
* intended and actual deployment setting.
* specific set of users. 
* operator or subject expectations. 
* concept of operations. 
* intended purpose and impact of system use. 
* requirements for system deployment and operation. 
* potential negative impacts to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society – or context-specific impacts such as legal requirements or impacts to the environment. 
* unintended, downstream, or other unknown contextual factors.
* TEST

<summary markdown="span">**Actions**</summary>

* Pursue AI system design purposefully, after non-AI solutions are considered. 
* Define and document the task, purpose, minimum functionality, and benefits of the AI system to inform considerations about whether the project is worth pursuing.
* Maintain awareness of industry, technical, and applicable legal standards.
* Collaboratively consider intended AI system design tasks along with unanticipated purposes.
* Determine the user and organizational requirements, including business and technical requirements.
* Define the AI system context of use, including:
    * operational environment
    * impacts to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society
    * user characteristics and tasks
    * social environment.
* Track and document existing AI systems held by the organization, and those maintained or supported by third-party entities.
* Gain and maintain awareness about evaluating scientific claims related to AI system performance and benefits before launching into system design.
* Identify human-AI interaction and/or roles, such as whether the application will support or replace human decision making. 
* Plan for risks related to human-AI configurations, and document requirements, roles, and responsibilities for human oversight of deployed systems.

**Transparency Considerations – Key Questions: MAP 1.1**
* Who is ultimately responsible for the decisions of the AI and is this person aware of the intended uses and limitations of the analytic?
* Who will be responsible for maintaining, re-verifying, monitoring, and updating this AI once deployed?
* Who is accountable for the ethical considerations during all stages of the AI lifecycle?
* Why was the dataset created? (e.g., were there specific tasks in mind, or a specific gap that needed to be filled?
* How does the entity ensure that the data collected are adequate, relevant, and not excessive in relation to the intended purpose?
